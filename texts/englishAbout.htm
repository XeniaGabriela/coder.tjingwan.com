	<h1>My Personal Relation to Coding</h1>
	<br>
	I studied mathematics at the Leibniz University of Hanover. After finishing my diploma, which is roughly equivalent to a master, I worked at the Institute of Algebraic Geometry for some years. There I researched for the DFG Priority Project SPP 1489 with the title Algorithmic and Experimental Methods in Algebra, Geometry and Number Theory.<br>
	During this time, I implemented two libraries for normalization and desingularization of surfaces over integers and fields into the Computer Algebra System Singular.<br> 
	That was when I discovered my passion for coding. So I decided to look for coding positions in the industry.<br> 
	The first systems I wrote where for dynamic public transport information. I highly enjoy writing server and client systems. Network-programming evoked my curiosity for information security. So I began to participate on information security conferences and webcasts, like Black Hat Europe and eLearnSecurity.<br> 
	As browser-applications often where part of my Webserver and -client-systems, it was not a big step for me to start developing websites too.<br> 
	Currently I am working as a passsionate freelance coder. Feel free to contact me for you planned projects!
